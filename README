exup: a basic web application deployment script using SVN and FTP

The exup script requires the following python modules:
 - ftputil (python-ftputil)
 - m2crypto (python-m2crypto)
 - m2secret (available at http://www.heikkitoivonen.net/m2secret/, installable using easy_install)

Setup:
 - configure the location of your SVN repo in exupconfig.py
 - configure the location of your FTP credentials file in exupconfig.py (file will be created if it doesn't exist)
 - run "chmod +x exup.py ftpaccounteditor.py"

Usage:
 - Run "ftpaccounteditor.py" to add, edit or display FTP account information
   - When adding an account, "path" specifies the path on the FTP server where the files will be uploaded to
 - Run "exup.py" to run an export + upload (deploy)
